# surfs_up

### Purpose 
The purpose of the challenge / module was to get the temperature statistics during Summer & Winter seasons in Oahu. W. Avy likes our analysis, but he wants more information to find the trends before opening the surf shopso as to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. For analysis we used SQLAlchemy to query SQLite Database.
